## This is some kind of graphql chat application.

I don't know where i'm going with this project, but I hope it gets somewhere soon

### The app uses a global config folder that contains the following variables (naming isn't consistent, but whatever)

-   MONGO_CONNECTION_URI
-   secret

### Notes

-   Maybe I should provide a global package.json to install depenedencies and whatnot.
-   IDK what I'm doing on the front-end, but the gql part kinda works.
